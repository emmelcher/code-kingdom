      <li><b>Discrete Math</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This class will explore areas of math not usually covered in a typical math class, such as those used in Computer Science. We will cover
            topics such as graph theory, set theory, cryptography, logic, and problem solving. This class is designed to branch out into the everyday
            uses of math.

          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Consumer Math</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            Students will work with a variety of concepts ranging from, but not limited to, Sales Tax, Income Tax, Personal Bank Accounts, Simple
            and Compound Interest, Stocks, Bonds, Annuities, Installment Loans, Credit Cards, and the Cost of Home Ownership. This course will
            involve many real-world math scenarios and personal finance situations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Statistics</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            Students will develop an understanding of statistical concepts by analyzing real data. Topics studied include data collection, drawing
            conclusions, summarizing data, normal distributions, and inference from data. Technology will be used heavily in the course.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Intro to Computer Science</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is an introduction to computer science using the CMU CS Academy and/or Computer Science Discoveries by
            Code.org. By using a graphical design model, students will be introduced to the world of computer science through a fun and
            engaging computational problem-solving approach. After completing Introduction to Computer Programming, students can go on
            to learn other individual programming languages that build on concepts learned in this class but are tailored to specific computer
            science areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, app development, video game design, and cybersecurity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Computer Programming: Python</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is a journey into the programming language Python and it builds upon foundations established in Intro to Computer
            Programming. Python is a scripting language that is often used for creating Web applications and dynamic Web content. Python
            is also supported by many 2D and 3D imaging programs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Computer Programming: C++</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is a journey into the programming language C++ and it builds upon foundations established in Intro to Computer
            Programming. C++ is a general purpose, object oriented language that is built around the concepts of abstraction, inheritance,
            encapsulation, and polymorphism. C++ is highly portable and is often the language of choice for multi-device, multi-platform app
            development.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Computer Programming: Java</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is a journey into the programming language Java and it builds upon the foundations established in Intro to Computer
            Programming. Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that is designed to run on various devices with few
            dependencies. Java is the current language of the Computer Science A AP Exam and is the closest match to the pseudocode used
            in certification exams such as the Praxis exam.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Computer Programming: Visual Basic</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is a journey into the programming language Visual Basic and it builds upon the foundations established in Intro to
            Computer Programming. Visual Basic is a Windows based environment language that allows you to create applications with graphic
            interface capabilities. Concepts such as windows, buttons, forms, databases, and file structures will be explored. While not a video game
            level graphics language, Visual Basic does leave the text based environment behind for a more interactive program environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Computer Programming: HTML/CSS</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is a journey into the programming languages of HTML and CSS, and it builds upon the foundations established in Intro to
            Computer Programming. HTML and CSS go hand in hand in the development of websites and web applications.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>Advanced Computer Programming: Independent Study</b></li>
        <ul class="course-desc">
          <li>
            This course is designed to be an extension or exploration into any of the other programming languages that have been offered. Concepts
            that can be studied include, but are not limited to, app development, game development, database programming, development with
            Raspberry Pi, development with Arduino, and programming with Sphero.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li><b>AP Computer Science Principles</b></li>
      <ul class="course-desc">

          This is an AP course with a broad look into Computer Science and will follow the AP Computer Science Principles Framework. Topics
          that will be covered include, but are not limited to, Digital Information, The Internet, Programming, Data Analysis, Cybersecurity,
          Apps, Digital Forensics, and Communications. The use of Performance Tasks and Online Tools will be a large part of this course. The
          taking of the AP Exam is strongly encouraged.
