# Code Kingdom

Created for use as a homepage for a teacher at my high school, as well as my senior project for my technical school.

## Description

It's a regular website, created to be specific to my teacher. Written using HTML/CSS. It doesn't have mobile capabilities because I didn't include any bootstrap,
or any JavaScript. This was a small project which took me a few months to complete. It's nothing incredibly fancy, but you're welcome to change and
customize it as you'd like.
