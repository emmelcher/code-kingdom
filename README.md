# Code Kingdom

Created for use as a homepage for a teacher at my high school, as well as my senior project for my technical school.

## Description

It's a website created specifically for one of my teachers at my High School, Mr. Farr. It was intended to be used as a teacher homepage for him. It was written using HTML/CSS. It doesn't have mobile capabilities because I didn't include any bootstrap, or any JavaScript. This was a small project which took me a few months to complete. It's nothing incredibly fancy, but you're welcome to explore it as you'd like.
