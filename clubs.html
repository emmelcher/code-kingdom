            Academic Challenge is a forum for students to compete against other Berks County Schools in the areas of Math, Science, Literature, Social Studies, Arts, and Current Events.
            Structured somewhat like Jeopardy, students compete on teams against one or two other schools at a time. Scores and records are kept based on wins and losses,
            and the top teams can even move on and compete at a Regional and State level.
            Practices are usually held once a week and the competitions are once a month in November, December, January, and February.

            The Computing Club was formed with the intent to further students’ interests in the area of Computer Science. Whether a student is enrolled in available computer classes or not,
            Computing Club exists as a spring board into any area of computing that a student may be interested in. Currently, we are delving into Cybersecurity, Digital Forensics, Computer Programming,
            and Computer Science Theory. As interest increases, contests such as the CSAW High School Forensics Competition, the Bloomsburg Computer Programming Contest, and
            the American Computer Science League (ACSL) exist to take part in. All ideas and levels of computer knowledge are welcome.
